# RPi_data_logger for the MightyOhm Geiger Müller radiation detector
Together with a simple user interface board (see documentation) and the
MightyOhm do-it-yourself Geiger-Müller counter set, this
python3 software aims to facilitate a portable "field" datalogger to
measure, log, evaluate and display radioactivity.

The hardware (based on any raspberry pi model with the 40pin header) aims to
be energy efficient and compact.
